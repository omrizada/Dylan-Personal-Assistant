## Communication Flow

1. **You** send a message in a Telegram topic (e.g., the "Work" topic)
2. The **Input Guard** screens the message for prompt injection, credential extraction, and social engineering
3. The **Account Manager** for that channel receives the message. Each AM has a distinct personality and context loaded from `channels/<name>/context.md`
4. The AM decides whether to handle it directly or escalate to the **Chief of Staff**
4. The Chief of Staff **routes** the request to the appropriate specialist agent(s)
5. Specialist agents read from the **Brain** (markdown files) for context
6. The response flows back through the AM, which adapts tone for the channel
7. The **Librarian** evaluates whether the interaction should update the Brain

## Brain Connectivity Design

Every brain file MUST be connected to at least one other file via `[[wikilinks]]`. This ensures the knowledge graph has no orphan nodes and all information is discoverable through traversal.

### Connection Rules
1. **No orphans**: Every file links to at least one other file
2. **Bidirectional awareness**: If A links to B, B should ideally link back to A
3. **Hub files**: `Dashboard.md`, `BRAIN_INDEX.md`, and `projects.md` serve as high-connectivity hubs
4. **Cross-domain links**: Work and Side Project files share connections through `role-and-goals.md` and `priorities.md`
5. **Resource chains**: Summary → Insights → Projects → Stakeholders forms a natural chain

### Life Domain Separation

The brain supports multiple life domains that are separate but share fundamentals:

```
brain/
├── context/          ← SHARED (role, goals, decisions apply everywhere)
├── preferences/      ← SHARED (your style is consistent across domains)
├── learnings/        ← SHARED (patterns transcend domains)
├── channels/
│   ├── work/         ← DOMAIN-SPECIFIC (primary job)
│   ├── side-project/ ← DOMAIN-SPECIFIC (side hustle)
│   ├── personal/     ← DOMAIN-SPECIFIC (life admin)
│   └── development/  ← DOMAIN-SPECIFIC (system meta)
└── resources/        ← MIXED (organized by source, linked to relevant domain)
```

**Shared fundamentals** (`context/`, `preferences/`, `learnings/`):
- `role-and-goals.md` captures ALL roles (work + side project + personal)
- `priorities.md` ranks across domains (work deadline vs personal commitment)
- `communication.md` is your voice everywhere
- `patterns.md` captures cross-domain insights

**Domain-specific** (`channels/`):
- Each domain has its own brain subdirectory
- Account Managers only load their domain's files
- Prevents context bleed (work context doesn't leak into personal)

**Connection points** between domains:
- `role-and-goals.md` is the master hub linking all domains
- `priorities.md` enables cross-domain prioritization
- `Dashboard.md` shows everything in one view
- Resource insights can link across domains when relevant

### Wikilink Conventions
- Link to filename without extension: `[[projects]]`, `[[stakeholders]]`
- For subdirectory files: `[[brain/channels/work/context|Work Context]]`
- Use display names for clarity: `[[stakeholders|Jane Smith]]`
- Add links naturally within existing text, not as separate "Related" sections

## The Brain

The brain is a collection of markdown files that serve as the assistant's long-term memory. Files are organized into **three loading tiers** (Hot/Warm/Cold) to optimize context window usage — see `BRAIN_INDEX.md` for the full tier mapping. It has four layers:

### Context Layer (`brain/context/`)
Who you are and what you are working on. Contains your role, active projects, key people, past decisions, and domain terminology. This is the factual foundation.

### Preferences Layer (`brain/preferences/`)
How you like things done. Communication tone, analysis frameworks, document formatting, and priority weights. These shape every response.

### Learnings Layer (`brain/learnings/`)
Patterns discovered through interactions. What worked, what didn't, corrections you gave, and strategies that proved effective. This is how the system improves over time.

### Resources Layer (`brain/resources/`)
Digested knowledge from documents you feed the system via `/ingest`. Summaries of each resource plus cross-cutting insights that connect ideas across resources.

### Channel Brain (`brain/channels/`)
Per-channel context that lets each Account Manager maintain specialized knowledge. The Work channel brain knows about your job; the Side Project brain knows about your startup.

### How the Brain Grows

The brain grows through three mechanisms:

1. **Onboarding** (`/onboard`): Interactive Q&A session that populates the initial brain files
2. **Auto-learning**: After significant interactions, the Librarian evaluates whether to update brain files. Learnings files are updated automatically; context and preference files require your confirmation.
3. **Manual teaching** (`/learn`): You can directly tell the system something new

### Brain Rules

- Brain files never exceed 500 lines. If a file grows too large, the Librarian splits it.
- Context and preference updates are proposed to you before being written.
- Learning updates (patterns, feedback, strategies) are written automatically.
- The `BRAIN_INDEX.md` is always kept up to date with last-modified dates.
- Brain files are gitignored by default (they contain personal data).

## Agent Team

### Account Managers (5)

Each Telegram topic maps to an Account Manager. The AM is the user-facing personality layer. It:
- Receives messages from the user
- Loads channel-specific context from `channels/<name>/context.md` and `brain/channels/<name>/`
- Handles simple requests directly
- Escalates complex requests to the Chief of Staff
- Adapts the response tone to match the channel personality

### Specialist Agents (10)

| Agent | Expertise | Typical Triggers |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Chief of Staff | Orchestration, routing, multi-agent coordination | Complex/ambiguous requests, briefings |
| Analyst | Data analysis, pattern recognition, frameworks | "analyze", "break down", metrics |
| Strategist | Planning, decision frameworks, roadmaps | "strategy", "prioritize", tradeoffs |
| Writer | Document creation, editing, tone adaptation | "write", "draft", "edit" |
| Critic | Devil's advocate, risk assessment, blind spots | "challenge", "what am I missing" |
| Market Researcher | External research, competitive intelligence | "research", "competitors", "benchmark" |
| Onboarding Coach | Brain population, preference gathering | `/onboard`, weekly check-ins |
| Librarian | Knowledge management, resource processing | `/ingest`, brain maintenance |
| Security Scanner | Automated security scans via Caterpillar | Agent/skill/config file changes |
| Input Guard | Message screening for prompt injection and social engineering | Every incoming Telegram message |

### Multi-Agent Workflows

Some requests trigger multiple agents in sequence:

- **Analyze then Strategize**: Analyst breaks down the situation, Strategist develops the plan
- **Research then Analyze**: Market Researcher gathers data, Analyst synthesizes it
- **Strategize then Critique**: Strategist proposes, Critic stress-tests
- **Write then Review**: Writer drafts, Critic reviews for gaps

## Slash Commands

| Command | Agent | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `/brief` | Chief of Staff | Morning briefing with current state and pending decisions |
| `/analyze` | Analyst | Deep structured analysis of a topic or resource |
| `/strategize` | Strategist | Strategic thinking session with frameworks |
| `/draft` | Writer | Create a document matching your style preferences |
| `/challenge` | Critic | Devil's advocate session to stress-test thinking |
| `/research` | Market Researcher | Web research on competitors, markets, trends |
| `/ingest` | Librarian | Process a document into the brain |
| `/onboard` | Onboarding Coach | Populate the brain through interactive Q&A |
| `/learn` | Librarian | Manually teach the system something new |
| `/status` | Chief of Staff | System health — brain freshness, security, backlog |
| `/decide` | Strategist + Critic | Structured decision framework with stress testing |
| `/digest` | Librarian | Weekly digest of brain updates and learnings |
| `/weekly-review` | Chief of Staff + Strategist | End-of-week retrospective and next-week planning |
| `/meeting-prep` | Chief of Staff + Analyst + Writer | Pre-meeting briefing with attendee context |
| `/followup` | Writer | Track commitments, surface overdue items, draft nudges |
| `/triage` | Chief of Staff + Analyst + Writer | Scan, classify, and draft responses for emails |
| `/premortem` | Critic + Strategist | Structured failure analysis before launching initiatives |
| `/report` | Writer + Analyst | Auto-generate status reports for different audiences |
| `/reflect` | Onboarding Coach | Guided reflection with spaced repetition of insights |
| `/repurpose` | Writer | Transform content into multiple formats for channels |
| `/prioritize` | Strategist | Multi-framework task prioritization |
| `/okr` | Strategist | Define, track, and review quarterly OKRs |
| `/delegate` | Chief of Staff + Writer | Track delegated tasks with automated follow-ups |
| `/extract-wisdom` | Analyst + Librarian | Quick extraction of key ideas from content |
| `/negotiate` | Strategist + Critic | Structured negotiation preparation |
| `/postmortem` | Analyst + Critic | Blameless after-action review with root cause analysis |
| `/coach` | Strategist + Writer | Leadership coaching for difficult conversations |

## Auto-Learning System

After every significant interaction, the Librarian evaluates whether brain files should be updated:

| Signal | Brain File Updated |
|--------|--------------------|
| New person mentioned with role | `brain/context/stakeholders.md` |
| New term or jargon used | `brain/context/terminology.md` |
| Project status changed | `brain/context/projects.md` |
| Decision made with rationale | `brain/context/decisions-log.md` |
| User corrected the system | `brain/learnings/feedback.md` |
| Preference expressed | `brain/preferences/` (with confirmation) |
| Strategy worked or failed | `brain/learnings/strategies.md` |
| Recurring pattern observed | `brain/learnings/patterns.md` |

## Graceful Degradation

The system works at different capability levels depending on available integrations:

| Integration | What It Enables | Without It |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Telegram plugin | Multi-channel messaging | Use directly in Claude Code terminal |
| WebSearch | Market research, current data | Research agent limited to brain knowledge |
| WebFetch | URL content retrieval | Cannot fetch external pages |
| CronCreate | Scheduled briefings, reminders | Manual-only triggering |
| MCP tools (Calendar, Email, etc.) | Direct integrations | Copy-paste workflow |

The core value -- the brain, agents, and slash commands -- works with Claude Code alone, no plugins required.
